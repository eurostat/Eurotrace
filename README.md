# Eurotrace
EUROTRACE is a modular software suite for processing international trade statistics, featuring a database management system (EUROTRACE DBMS) for data compilation, an editor for data entry (EUROTRACE Editor) and a visualization tool (Comext standalone).

Since the 1980s, the European Commission has implemented numerous statistical cooperation programmes with non-EU countries, including the Western Balkans, TACIS, ASEAN, and ACP countries. These programmes have focused on developing tools and providing assistance for their effective use. One such tool, EUROTRACE, was developed and deployed by Eurostat to facilitate the processing and dissemination of international trade in goods statistics.

**Overview of EUROTRACE**

EUROTRACE Windows is a generic, open system designed to adapt to national and regional requirements as well as to various types of statistics. Its deployment began in the 2000s, and today it is used in approximately 100 countries worldwide.The system comprises the following components:
- Database Management System (EUROTRACE DBMS): Handles metadata management, data storage, validation, and compilation (e.g., aggregation).
- Editor (EUROTRACE Editor): Facilitates manual entry of data sourced from paper records and allows for the correction of errors.
- Multidimensional Spreadsheet (COMEXT Standalone): A virtual spreadsheet for browsing and extracting data from EUROTRACE datasets.
Each module is independently installable, offering users flexibility to deploy only the components they require. This modular architecture allows EUROTRACE to complement existing software within a country.

**Key Features of EUROTRACE**

- Automated Data Import: EUROTRACE can automatically read various electronic file formats, such as ASYCUDA (Automated System for Customs Data). Developed by UNCTAD in Geneva, ASYCUDA is a comprehensive customs management tool that supports foreign trade procedures, including manifests, customs declarations, accounting, transit, and suspense procedures.
- Error Minimisation: For data available only on paper, manual entry often introduces additional errors. The EUROTRACE Editor addresses this by validating data in real time, significantly reducing entry mistakes.
- Customisable Data Visualisation: The COMEXT Standalone application provides a user-friendly interface for visualising data. It connects directly to the EUROTRACE DBMS and enables the creation of customised statistical tables.
